{"name":"-=[ ictk ]=- Internet Chess Toolkit","tagline":"A Java chess modeling library that supports generating legal moves, PGN (with variations), FEN, NAG, and limited ICS (Internet Chess Server) support.","body":"## SPECIFICATIONS & DESIGN\r\n\r\n   If you're looking for a super fast Java implementation of a chess model \r\nto use as a basis for a chess engine you need to look elsewhere.  The \r\ndesign goal of this library has never been speed.  If it were it would \r\ncreate a LOT fewer objects.  Instead, the goal of ictk is to render chess\r\nin a natural object oriented way that is both easy to use and well documented.  \r\n\r\n   This library started out in 1997 as a proof of Object Oriented Design \r\nconcepts.  The chess pieces act as agents and generate their own moves after\r\nanalysis of the board state.  A move object is an implementation of a \r\nCommand Pattern.  And so on.  \r\n\r\n   The Internet Chess Server (ICS/FICS) support converts the server's telent\r\ntext into POJOs, implementing a MVC based EventListener model for client code\r\nto easily process.  As Java is overly verbose, and the messages are relatively\r\nsimplistic, the parsing is done in XML and converted to Java POJOs via XSTL.\r\nThe approach may seem overly complex to you, but saves a lot of time.\r\n\r\n   Finally, this is not a graphics library, it is a game modeling library.\r\nIt provides for reading and writing standard game notations as well.\r\n   \r\n## FEATURES\r\n* Object oriented Chess game model (MVC based)\r\n* Legal move generation\r\n* Game history with variation support (alternative move suggestions)\r\n* Move comment support in text and Numeric Annotation Glyphs (NAG)\r\n* Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) read/write support (internationalized\r\n  for presentation in 16 languages)\r\n* Portable Game Notation (PGN) read/write support (including move variations,\r\n  and FEN)\r\n* Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) read/write support\r\n* True MVC structure with board displays driven by game model events\r\n* Command-line Board display\r\n* Well documented. Sample code also provided.\r\n* FICS support [(freechess.org)](http://www.freechess.org)\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\n   ictk is distributed under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nThe following commands will retrieve the latest source, generate the source code through XSLT, compile, create the Java-Doc and make the full jar file.  Just add the jar file to your `CLASSPATH`.\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/jvarsoke/ictk\r\n    $ cd ictk\r\n    $ ant build\r\n\r\n##FEEDBACK\r\n   If you find this library useful, drop me an email just to let me know what\r\nyou're doing with it.  Even if you're just messing around.  Knowing someone is\r\nusing this encourages me to dedicate time toward improving ictk -- otherwise\r\nI have lots of other things to donate my time to.  Thanks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
