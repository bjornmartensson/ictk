<p>If you're looking for a super fast Java implementation of a chess model 
to use as a basis for a chess engine you need to look elsewhere.  The 
design goal of this library has never been speed.  If it were it would 
create a LOT fewer objects.  Instead, the goal of ictk is to render chess
in a natural object oriented way that is both easy to use and well documented.  </p>

<p>This library started out in 1997 as a proof of Object Oriented Design 
concepts.  The chess pieces act as agents and generate their own moves after
analysis of the board state.  A move object is an implementation of a 
Command Pattern.  And so on.  </p>

<p>The Internet Chess Server (ICS/FICS) support converts the server's telent
text into POJOs, implementing a MVC based EventListener model for client code
to easily process.  As Java is overly verbose, and the messages are relatively
simplistic, the parsing is done in XML and converted to Java POJOs via XSTL.
The approach may seem overly complex to you, but saves a lot of time.</p>

<p>Finally, this is not a graphics library, it is a game modeling library.
It provides for reading and writing standard game notations as well.</p>

<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>The following commands will retrieve the latest source, generate the source code through XSLT, compile, create the Java-Doc and make the full jar file.  Just add the jar file to your <code>CLASSPATH</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jvarsoke/ictk
$ cd ictk
$ ant build
</code></pre>

<a name="feedback" class="anchor" href="#feedback"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FEEDBACK</h2>

<p>If you find this library useful, drop me an email just to let me know what
you're doing with it.  Even if you're just messing around.  Knowing someone is
using this encourages me to dedicate time toward improving ictk -- otherwise
I have lots of other things to donate my time to.  Thanks.</p>
