1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.e4 d6 6.Nge2 e5 
    ( 6...c5 {This continuation has a better percentage for Black. } 7.O-O Nc6 
    8.d3 {three main choices from here.} )
7.O-O Nc6 8.h3 a5 {first out of book move.} 
    ( 8...Be6 {the is more common.} 9.d3 Qd7 10.Kh2 = {Ne8 or Nh5 from here.} )
9.d3 h6 10.Be3 Nh7 11.Qd2 g5 12.Nd5 f5 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.Nec3 Nd4! {This was a 
really slick move.  He's gotta watch for the fork on Nf3.  The Nd4 knight 
covers b5 against the knight invasion.  And also allows for the pawn push c6 
ejecting his Nd5 knight.  Also, the knight doesn't really have anywhere to go.}
15.Kh2? {Nd5 is vulnerable -- no home.} 15...c6! 16.f4 cxd5 {missed the check 
here, but probably still would have played it.} 
    ( 16...gxf4! {This seems really dangerous, but opens the K-side up for 
    attack.} 17.gxf4 cxd5 18.Bxd5+ Kh8 19.Bxb7 Rb8 20.Bg2 Qh4 21.Ne4 -/+ )
17.Bxd5+ Kh8 18.Bxb7 Rb8 19.Bg2 Bd7 
    ( 19...gxf4 {Still an option here.} 20.gxf4 Qh4 21.Ne4 -/+ )
20.Qf2 Nf5 21.Ba7! {This was a good move, there are very few places for me to 
put that rook.  I want to open up the a1-h8 diagonal so I can use the b2 sq as 
a home for my rook (covered by the Bishop).} 21...exf4 {he obviously can't take
the rook this move.} 22.gxf4 
    ( {he obviously can't take the rook this move.} 22.Bxb8?? fxg3+!! )
22...Rb4 23.a3 Rb3 24.Qc2 Rb8?! {very questionable.  But if he takes the Rook 
with BxRb8 I can fork the Q and Rook for an even exchange.} 
    ( 24...a4! {missed this!  ugh.  forgot that the bishop would support the 
    pawn.} )
25.Bxb8 Ne3 26.Qb3 {He's trying to cover the Bb8 bishop but that doesn't work.}
26...Nxf1+ 27.Rxf1 Qxb8 28.Qxb8 Rxb8 29.fxg5 Nxg5 
    ( 29...Rxb2!! {This was the better move.  I considered it because the B 
    would be pinned and the Nc3 knight would be a target.  Not sure why I 
    didn't play it though.} )
30.h4 Be5+ {forcing the King back into the corner.} 31.Kh1 Nh3 {trading off is 
good for me.} 
    ( 31...Ne6 {might have been better but I didn't like the prospects of 
    pinning that knight.} 32.Bh3? {this what I feared but I shouldn't have} 
    32...Rxb2 33.Bxe6 Bxe6 )
32.Rf7 Be6 33.Re7 Nf4 -+ {I have all the mobility here.  His rook can't really 
do much.} 34.Be4 Rxb2! 35.Nd5?? {terrible blunder.  TACTIC!} 35...Rb1+ 36.Kh2 
Nxd5+ 37.Kg2 Nxe7 38.d4 Bxd4? {dumb, but the game is over now anyway.} 39.Bxb1 
Bxc4 40.Kf3 Kg7 41.Ke4 Bf2 42.h5 Be2 43.a4 Bxh5 44.Bd3 Bg6+ 45.Kf3 Bxd3 46.Kxf2
Bc2 47.Ke3 Bxa4 48.Kd4 Bb3 49.Ke4 a4 50.Kd3 h5 51.Ke4 h4 52.Kd3 h3 53.Ke4 h2 
54.Kd3 h1=Q 55.Kd4 Qd5+ 56.Ke3 Nf5+ 57.Kf4 Nd4 58.Ke3 Nc2+ 59.Kf4 Qe5+ 60.Kg4 
Be6+ 61.Kh4 Qf4+ 62.Kh5 Qh6# {White checkmated} 0-1
