<p>The FICS event package contains all events and parsers for those events 
that are generated from FICS servers.  Most of the default ICS parsers 
appear here.  The events they are associated with generally appear in the 
ICS event package.
<p>Each parser implements the Singleton design pattern. Thus there can only be
once instance of each parser (why would you nee more?).  You can get that
instance via the .getInstance() method.
<p>The toNative() method allows ICSEvents to be translated back into their
original server output.  This is also mapped to the default 
ICSEvent.toString() function
