The ICS event package contains all events and parsers for those events 
that are generated from ICS servers.  Most of the parsers appear under 
the event section of the specific servers (with the default being FICS).
Some of the event objects represent server messages that look different
but are of the same category.  For example the a shout and an emote-shout
are unified under the Channel event -- since shout is basically just another
channel.<br>
This package is under heavy construction and aims to categorize all 
server output into event classes.
