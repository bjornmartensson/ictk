The GUI package contains classes for various types of Graphic User
Interface display widgets common to chess (clocks, boards, pieces etc).  
Swing, AWT, and SWT (as well as others) will find their place here.  
<p>
There are no GUI display objects as yet.  After the FICS server handling
settles down attention will be directed at getting some widgets here. 
But, <em>submissions of good GUI ChessBoards would be greatfully 
appreciated</em>.
