The purpose of this package is to supply abstract classes that
facilitate the implementation of turn-based boardgames.  Most
classes in this package are abstract and do not have much to them
except a skeleton.  The notable exceptions are History, Move and
ContinuationList (and it's implementations).  
These three classes create a datastructure that resembles a
tree.  It's a history of the moves in the game and includes 
variations.  While the History class maintains access to the 
datastructure, Moves are nodes on the structure and ContinuationList
allows for the branching that variations necessitate.  ContinuationList
is also used for promoting and demoting variations to the mainline.
